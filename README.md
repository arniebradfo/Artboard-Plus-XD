# Artboard Plus

Artboard tools to speed up your Adobe XD workflow. Rearrange artboards into grid, sort them by name or create an artboard around selection.

## Rearange artboards into grid

Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Rearrange Artboards into Grid` to rearrange all artboards in the document. If you have selected artboards, it will rearrange only the selected ones.

### Arrange All Artboards

### Arrange Selected Artboards

## Create artboard around selection

Select the layers that you want to create an artboard for and run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Create Artboard Around Selection`

## Sort artboards

Sort artboards by name in the layer list. Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards by Name A-Z` for ascending order or `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards by Name Z-A` for descending order

## Settings

This is where you set the horizontal and vertical spacing when rearranging artboards. **Due to Adobe XD incompatibility these settings can only be saved globally and not per document**
